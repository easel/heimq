# Review — Bead Review and Quorum Review

DDx has two distinct review concepts. They are **not interchangeable**.

| Concept | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Bead review** | `ddx bead review <id>` | Grades a bead's implementation against its declared acceptance criteria. Per-AC verdict with evidence. |
| **Quorum review** | `ddx agent run --quorum=<policy> --harnesses=<list>` | Dispatches a review prompt across multiple harnesses and aggregates the verdicts. Used for high-stakes or adversarial checks. |

## Bead review

```bash
ddx bead review <bead-id>
```

Generates a review-ready prompt that includes:

- Bead title, description, acceptance criteria (verbatim).
- Governing artifact content (follows `spec-id`).
- The diff since the bead's base commit (execution evidence commits
  excluded — see the related bug ddx-39e27896 for exclusion
  pathspec).
- Review instructions: output contract, verdict taxonomy.

The reviewer (whoever receives the prompt — a human, a harness via
`ddx agent run`, or a quorum) produces a structured verdict:

```
## Bead review: ddx-<id>

### Verdict: APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES | BLOCK

### Per-criterion

1. [AC text]
   Verdict: APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES | BLOCK
   Evidence: <file:line, test output, diff hunk, or explicit "not verifiable">

2. [AC text]
   ...

### Summary
<1-3 sentences of overall context>

### Findings
<detailed issues, if any; omit when verdict is APPROVE with no findings>
```

The review output can be stored as bead evidence:

```bash
ddx bead evidence add <id> --type review --body <path-to-review.md>
```

## Quorum review

```bash
ddx agent run --quorum=majority --harnesses=claude,codex,gemini \
  --prompt review-prompt.md
```

`--quorum=<policy>` values:

- `majority` — at least ⌈N/2⌉ harnesses must agree on the verdict.
- `unanimous` — all harnesses must agree.
- `any` — pass if any harness APPROVES (rarely useful; adversarial
  checks should require stronger consensus).

Use quorum when:

- The change is high-stakes (migrations, security surface, API
  contracts, auth).
- The review surface is controversial and one harness's opinion
  isn't enough.
- You want adversarial pressure against a single-model blindspot
  (different model families have different failure modes).

The aggregated output shows each harness's verdict side-by-side plus
the aggregate decision. Disagreements are surfaced, not hidden.

## Required evidence format

Both review kinds share an evidence contract: **no verdict without
evidence.**

- "APPROVE" with no `Evidence:` lines → reject as malformed.
- "REQUEST_CHANGES" without pointing at the change needed → reject.
- "BLOCK" without a reason → reject (see the related bug
  ddx-39e27896 about `review-malfunction` retries).

Evidence takes one of these forms:

1. **File:line reference**: `cli/internal/bead/store.go:142`
2. **Test output**: `FAIL: TestBeadClose_UnclaimsOnNonSuccess (0.01s)`
3. **Diff hunk**: a short quote from the diff showing the offending
   or approved change.
4. **Explicit "not verifiable"**: the AC is written in a way that
   cannot be mechanically checked; flag this as a bead-authoring
   issue rather than silently approving.

## Anti-patterns

- **Hallucinated approval.** "Looks good to me!" with no per-AC
  grading. The review is worthless.
- **Reviewing the prompt instead of the diff.** The reviewer evaluated
  "what you intended" not "what you actually changed." Verdict must
  reference the diff or the resulting code.
- **Verdict without evidence.** Every verdict must have at least one
  evidence line; APPROVE is no exception (evidence can be "AC met:
  `go test ./foo/... passes` output attached").
- **Silencing disagreement in quorum.** If two harnesses disagree,
  don't collapse to a single "decision." Surface the disagreement
  in the output and let the human decide.
- **Quorum for routine work.** Single-harness bead review is fine
  for most beads. Reserve quorum for the cases that justify the
  cost.

## Subagents: not this skill's business

Some harnesses can run a quorum in forked/isolated subagent
contexts; each harness implements this differently. This skill
doesn't specify how isolation is achieved —
`ddx agent run --quorum=<policy> --harnesses=<list>` is the
portable invocation, and the harness decides whether to fork,
spawn, or run inline.

## CLI reference

```bash
# Bead review (single-reviewer AC grading)
ddx bead review <id>                           # generate review prompt
ddx bead review <id> --execute --harness claude  # dispatch and grade
ddx bead evidence add <id> --type review --body r.md  # store review

# Quorum review (multi-harness)
ddx agent run --quorum=majority \
  --harnesses=claude,codex \
  --prompt review.md

ddx agent run --quorum=unanimous \
  --harnesses=claude,codex,gemini \
  --prompt review.md
```
