# DDx

This project uses [DDx](https://github.com/DocumentDrivenDX/ddx) for
document-driven development. Use the `ddx` skill for beads, work,
review, agents, and status — every skills-compatible harness (Claude
Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.) discovers it from
`.claude/skills/ddx/` and `.agents/skills/ddx/`.

## Files to commit

After modifying any of these paths, stage and commit them:

- `.ddx/beads.jsonl` — work item tracker
- `.ddx/config.yaml` — project configuration
- `.agents/skills/ddx/` — the ddx skill (shipped by ddx init)
- `.claude/skills/ddx/` — same skill, Claude Code location
- `docs/` — project documentation and artifacts

## Conventions

- Use `ddx bead` for work tracking (not custom issue files).
- Documents with `ddx:` frontmatter are tracked in the document graph.
- Run `ddx doctor` to check environment health.
- Run `ddx doc stale` to find documents needing review.

## Merge Policy

Branches containing `ddx agent execute-bead` or `execute-loop` commits
carry a per-attempt execution audit trail:

- `chore: update tracker (execute-bead <TIMESTAMP>)` — attempt heartbeats
- `Merge bead <bead-id> attempt <TIMESTAMP>- into <branch>` — successful lands
- `feat|fix|...: ... [ddx-<id>]` — substantive bead work

Bead records store `closing_commit_sha` pointers into this history. Any
SHA rewrite breaks the trail. **Never squash, rebase, or filter** these
branches. Use only:

- `git merge --ff-only` when the target is a strict ancestor, or
- `git merge --no-ff` when divergence exists

Forbidden on execute-bead branches: `gh pr merge --squash`,
`gh pr merge --rebase`, `git rebase -i` with fixup/squash/drop,
`git filter-branch`, `git filter-repo`, and `git commit --amend` on
any commit already in the trail.
